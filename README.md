**A message from the CryptoKitties makers:**

**You've been permanently banned from participating in [r/CryptoKitties](https://old.reddit.com/r/CryptoKitties/). You won't be able to post or comment. Reason: Self-promotion.**

Yes, Dapper Labs - the $7.5 billion dollar CryptoKitties gambling operator & promotor - falesly (or is that fraudulently?) 
claiming it's a "video game with cute-little cartoon cats that you own 100%" - 
censors this author's public service message. Remember - I do not get paid for writing the pages here.
